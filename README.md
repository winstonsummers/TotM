# Approach
Gaming has been a big part of my life since I was young and rolled dice for my dad when he had friends over to play D&D. Much of my approach is based on the feeling of simply moving through a dungeon fighting monsters and collecting treasure.
# Hurdles
This has been a big learning expierence for me. I am new to coding so I ran into a lot of bugs and there are still a few, but I will continue improving the game to make these bugs few and add features.<br>
A couple known bugs are:
<ul>
  <li> Upon trying to load a second character, the stats from the first character and second character will appear together on the character sheet.
  <li> Even though a defeat message appears there is nothing to stop the PC from continuing to attack and move through rooms.
  <li> There is more styling I would like to include to give the game a better astetic.
</ul>
# For the Future
I am far from done where I am, infact I intend to have an update within a couple days of the inital launch. The commands that currently work are: Attack, Next-room, Load and Restart. This obviously makes the game pretty limited currently.<br>
The next commands I will be working on wil be: Pick-up, Equip, Unequip and Rest.<br>
